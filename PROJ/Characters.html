		<p>
			As the captain of the crew, Luffy has been<br>recognized by the World Government as the most dangerous member<br>of the Straw Hats. Due to Luffy being a relatively new pirate,<br>the World Government originally did not pay much attention<br>to him. However, with each new outrageous<br>exploit Luffy and his crew have accomplished,<br>their views on him have changed.

		<h2>Then there is the right hand man, Zoro </h2>

		<p>
			Recognized as a powerful fighter within<br>the Straw Hats through his battles with various<br>opponents, Zoro is given a bounty by the World<br>Government with just as much recognition<br>as Luffy in terms of being a powerful threat.

		<h2>Then there is the Chef of the Ship, Sanji </h2>
