							It is unknown how long the world has existed or how it was created. It has been stated that due to the unique climates of the Grand Line, island cultures can remain unchanged for tens of thousands of years. It has also been theorized that Sekiteiun have existed for tens of thousands of years. This is the earliest period of time that has been referenced in the series thus far.The Blue Sea
							The Blue Sea, which makes up the entire world, consists of one large continent, one long chain of islands, and four seas that make up two larger oceans. The continent is called the Red Line, the big chain of islands is called the Grand Line and the four seas are called North Blue, South Blue, East Blue and West Blue. There is also a sea known as All Blue, where all the seas flow into, but the location of this sea is not yet known.
						<br><br>
							As explained above, North Blue, South Blue, East Blue and West Blue make up the four seas of the world. Within each Blue, sea travel works as it does in the real world. One can sail to any destination you want with a regular compass. However getting from one Blue to another is much more difficult. The reason is not only because the Red Line separates the two oceans, but also because the seas within one ocean are separated by a large sea route called the Grand Line as well as two Calm Belts.
